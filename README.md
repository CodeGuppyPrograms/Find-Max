In this tutorial we will show you how to locate an element in an hierarchical structure.

There are many kind of hierarchical structures that need to be traversed in order to find an element (e.g. a file in a folder structure).

To simplify things we will use a JavaScript jagged array containg just numbers and / or other arrays of numbers:

```
var ar = [2, 4, 10, [12, 4, [100, 99], 4], [3, 2, 99], 0];
```

Let's see how to find the maximum number in this array.
